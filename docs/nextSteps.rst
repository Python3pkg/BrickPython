BrickPython - Possible Next Steps
=================================

There are some obvious omissions in BrickPython.  Here are some next steps we've been considering:

*   Support for more Sensors.  This is likely to require a new way to configure the sensors,
    and corresponding modifications to the :class:`.BrickPiWrapper` class.
    I2C sensors may require an enhancement to the framework.
    Ideally we'd like to integrate the classes already available for the more complex sensors.
..

*   Better integration within BrickPi_Python?

*   Support for Python 3.x?
