Quick Start
===========

Already have a BrickPi set up and configured?  Want to get started quickly?  Here's how.

To install BrickPython, use::

	sudo pip install BrickPython

(or `sudo easy_install BrickPython` if you haven't installed pip yet)

Then take a sample application from https://github.com/charlesweir/BrickPython/tree/develop/ExamplePrograms .

Suppose you chose DoorControl.py.  You can run it using::

    python DoorControl.py

or if this gives security errors, try::

	sudo python DoorControl.py

And you're away...
